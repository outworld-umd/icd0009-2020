                Create a simple quiz/poll application.<br>
                Create quiz (admin only), answer to quiz (public or registered users). Quiz questions should be of multiple-choice type (ie many choices, only one
                can be selected - radio buttons). One answer can be marked as correct choice during quiz creation for statistics (but not mandatory, some
                quizzes do not have any correct answers - polls for example).<br>
                Quiz - only one answer can be marked as correct.<br>
                Poll - no answer is correct: we are just collecting users feedback.<br>
                Front page shows statistics/results of all the quizzes and possibility to go answer to the quizzes.<br>
